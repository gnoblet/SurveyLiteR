# Test file for svy_quantile function
# Tests for SurveyLiteR svy_quantile function

# NOTE: svy_quantile function currently has architectural issues that prevent
# comprehensive testing. The function uses srvyr::survey_quantile() which
# returns columns with names like '_q25', '_q50', '_q75', etc., but the
# internal svy_make() function expects a column named 'stat'.
#
# This incompatibility needs to be resolved in the function implementation
# before full testing can be completed.
